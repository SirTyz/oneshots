Something has gone wrong in the small village nestled in the Starford countryside. It is up to the party to help the village and discover the dark secrets of the Town of Foolshope. In this mystery adventure, the party will have to question the villagers, find clues, search out the source of the town's dark secret, and find the farmer's missing daughter, Tillie. 


## ACT I: A Grim Discovery

Your party has been traveling along the southern borders of the kingdom of Starford. Yesterday you arrived late at night to a small town called Foolshope. You entered a small tavern with a sign hanging near the door. The words [**Players Decide Name**] are carved into the sign, with [**Players Describe Sign**] carved below. The party slept very little in the night, haunted by a feeling of discomfort and unease. The next morning, the party gathers downstairs and ventures out into the village. When the door swings open you encounter a terrible scene:

Black ooze covers the fronts of all the buildings along the dusty road. The occasional drip of the unidentified substance can be heard as it splatters against the ground. In the center of the village, a large stone statue lays on the ground toppled over and covered in the same black, ooze-like substance. The smell of burning sulphur hangs in the air.

Nearby you hear some voices discussing frantically what might've happened in the night. They seem to be as confused as you are. You hear that there might be some villagers missing.

Next to the toppled statue stand two men. They are quietly discussing the surrounding horror. You recognize one as the Innkeeper from last night. The other is a man dressed in black pants with a red shirt embroidered with the symbol of a large hound, who introduces himself as the Constable.

> As the party begins their investigations, they will talk with each villager. Make sure that you read each villager description in order to lead the party in the right direction. Ideally, the party will progress through their conversations in this order: Innkeeper -> Constable -> Famer -> Monk -> Silversmith -> Duke -> Dutchess. If the party somehow finds themselves speaking to the villagers in a different order than this, ensure that they speak to the Dutchess LAST. Individual conversations with the villagers can be skipped except for the conversation with the Dutchess. Do whatever it takes to get them to her Manor.

| Alan      | Constable   | Sole watchman over the town. Friendly and open to accepting help. A few travelers have been reporting members of their party going missing in the night over the past few days. Alan, mentions that he heard someone sobbing close to the Watkyn Farm before he turned in for the night. It was about 3am.                                                                                                                       |

| Derek     | Duke        | Owns the land that the people of Foolshope live on. Lives several miles outside of the village with his wife, Elizabeth.

| Elizabeth | Dutchess    | Lives several miles outside of the village with her husband, Derek. Enjoys staying up late at night and watching out her manor's large balcony. Last night she saw a formless figure slide across the landscape toward an abandoned fortress.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Thomas    | Innkeeper   | Often sees travelers come and go through town. Heard some travelers several days ago talking about a salesman who stopped them on the road and offered them a "magical tiara" to which they refused the offer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Lily      | Silversmith | Frequently visits the Duke's house to deliver her crafted silver jewelry. She says that the last time she spoke to him, he was shaken up by an encounter he had with a strange man he met on the road.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Gavin     | Monk        | Lives in the church just outside of town. With some convincing, he mentions that Tillie came to him two days ago and confessed she has done something terrible. When he questioned her about what she was saying, Tillie left leaving behind a small silver bracelet that looks like it was made by the town Silversmith.                                                                                                        |

## ACT II: The Road to the Foul Fort
After hearing that some unknown *thing* slid towards the old abandoned fort in the middle of the night, the party has decided to investigate. The road ahead of you is a twisting and obscured dirt path that looks rarely used. The party begins the long walk ahead of them... Along the way, bizarre gurgling noises can be heard in the distance, unsettling the entire party.

After a few miles of travel, the gurgling gets louder. When you *listen for a gurgling noise* roll WIS. *On a 1-6 you are accosted by a *Tremor Ooze*. *On a 7-9 you are ambushed by an *Ooze*. *On a 10+ you find a small *Oozling*.

> The amount of encounters can be determined by the GM. Each time you want the party to have an encounter, tell them that they hear a gurgling noise close by. When they react, have them roll from above.

Exhausted from their encounters with such horrors, the party approaches their destination. A large pile of stone rubble comes into full view. In the rubble of what appears to be the eastern tower, a large, cracked bell can be seen sitting atop the ancient stone. Across what would've been the courtyard there is an ancient wooden door covered in unknown and time-lost runes. Most of the plant life in the area has withered and wilted away.

## ACT III: What Lurks Below
Your party pulls open the door to the smell of sulphur. Once your eyes adjust to the lack of light, a set of stone-hewn stairs is revealed leading down into the earth. Along the walls are runes similar to those on the door behind you. The light of the setting sun reaches weakly into the mouth of the entrance. Cobwebs covered in moisture hang from the low-pitched ceilings and a feeling of claustrophobia sets in quickly. Gurgling can be heard echoing faintly deeper into the fort.

When you *listen for a gurgling noise* roll WIS. *On a 1-6 you are accosted by a *Ooze*. *On a 7-9 you are ambushed by an *Ooze-tainted Being* or an*Ooze-tainted Creature*. *On a 10+ you find a small *Oozling*.

There might be something inside.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Top Center      | Circular room with runes smeared across the floor in what appears to be blood. Three hallways lead out of this room.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Top Right       | An array of sleeping quarters used by the people who used to defend this fort. Across the hall are tiny jail cells used for containing the prisoners captured in battle. There is something inside one of the jail cells. *Roll on the [treasure table](#treasure)* if you can reach it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |  |
| Center Far Left | A supply room filled with barrels, and boxes. A drain with iron bars covering it is visible on the floor. When this room is entered, an Ooze bubbles up from inside the drain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |  |
| Center Left     | A room filled with the spoils of war from long ago. The party gains several hand fulls of gold in this room. Below this room is a long hallway with a pedestal at the end. A vase sits on top of the pedestal. Along the walls are acid sprayers. When you *attempt to cross the hallway* roll DEX. *On a 1-6 you are immediately sprayed by the acid taking 1d10 damage and are unable to cross. *On a 7-9 You cross, but you are sprayed with a cloud of acid. * On a 10+ You are able to cross without harm.                                  |
| Center Center   | A large underground lake. The water is teeming with schools of twisted and dark fish. It would be unwise to go for a swim in these waters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Center Right    | A cramped room filled with a hideous creature that strikes fear into those who lay eyes on it. Please refer to [ACT IV](#ACT-IV:-noxell's-layer) for this room.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Bottom Far Left | What looks to be the kitchen of the Fort. A large brick oven sits in the corner, and rusted pots and pans can be seen hanging from the walls. Upon further investigation, the ashes in the oven have something in them. *Roll on the [treasure table](#treasure)*                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Bottom Left     | The mess hall for the fort. The tables are stained with age-old wine. A distinct scent of time-lost feasts still hang in the air. You hear something in here... you notice a writhing mass begin to move out from under the table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Bottom Center   | The entry hall of the fort. In this room there is a large tapestry covered in moth-chewed holes depicting an order of knights kneeling in a triangular formation around a man with a golden sword.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Bottom Right    | A chapel dedicated to a god long lost to the ages. Six candle stands line the long chapel. Six benches are in between each candle stand. In front of the chapel is a pulpit with a bowl sitting directly in the center. At the back of the chapel is a tapestry in surprisingly good condition depicting a man with a golden sword beheading a woman in a green dress. If detected, there is a small crawlspace hidden behind the tapestry. This space leads outside of the fort into a large bush that covers up the entrance from the outside. |

## ACT IV: Noxell's Layer:

Before you lies a door stained in a black sludge that seems to swallow up the light emanating from your torch. Your quickly-dwindling torch reveals a pool of black ooze on the floor seeping out from under the door. Inside a strong and rhythmic *thump-thump* can be heard.

As you open the door, the darkness seems to pour out, completely extinguishing your torch with a cold rush of air reeking of rot and sulphur. When you *stumble into the darkness* roll WIS. *On a 1-6 you are grabbed by a slimy creature and lifted into the air. You are unable to move unless you are able to get out. *On a 7-9 You hear something approaching you. You may throw yourself further into the abyss to avoid it. *On a 10+ you are able to avoid harm. Take out a torch and light it if you have one.

#### Noxell Fight: 
| Name   | Size | Hitpoints                    | Damage | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------ | ---- | ---------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Noxell | Huge | 5 per tentacle (40 total HP) | 2d6    | Writhing mass of eight tentacles that is covered in black sludge. When you *lay eyes on the hideous abomination* roll CHA *On a 1-6 Drop to the ground and scream wildly. *On a 7-9 Avert your eyes at the cost of taking an action or take your action quickly proceeded by a fit of madness. *On a 10+ you are unaffected by the hideousness that lies in front of you. |
| ---    | ---  | ---                          | ---    | When Noxell *Vomits forth a black sludge* roll *On a 1-6 Noxell chokes on his own acid taking some damage. *On a 7-9 Noxell spews out a rain of acid dealing 1d6 to everyone but drops everyone in his grasp. *On a 10+ Noxell sprays the room with acid inflicting 1d6 to everyone.                                                                                      |

The final blow lands against the shimmering, moist, enflamed body of Noxell. The being swells up and pops like a bloated, rotting, overfilled pigskin, releasing a terrible stench that would test even the strongest fortitude. Left in the sludge is the convulsing body of a woman screaming unintelligible nonsense. You suspect that some form of healing could calm her. 

## ACT V: Justice Demands Retribution:
After curing the woman, she comes to several hours later.

#### Tillie's Tale
- She fell in love with the Monk back in town, and has been seeing him weekly for nearly 3 months.
- The monk told her that everyone around her would deny their relationship if she were to make it public, so she would have to run away with him if she wanted the relationship to last.
- She struggled with if she should leave her family and her home, or if she should go with the Monk. She finally decided to end it with the Monk two weeks ago.
- When she ended her relationship with the monk, he became furious and threatened to kill her. She ran home and become very sad, talking less and less. 
- A few days ago the monk sent her a letter telling her he was sorry and had a gift to make it up to her.
- When she arrived at the church, the monk was happier than she'd ever seen him, and offered her a silver tiara.
- Although she felt unsettled about the way he was acting, she put the tiara on and instantly felt sick.
- She tried to remove the tiara, but it was stuck on her head.
- She asked him what he had done to her, and he began to laugh maniacally.
- He told her he had bought the tiara from a shadowy salesman who claimed that if it was given to someone as a gift, it would bestow the gift-givers deepest wishes upon the gift-receiver. 
- She turned to run from the monk but he grabbed her arm before she could get away. She pulled away from him as hard as she could and fled towards her home.
- Over time she began to mutate into something terrible, slowly loosing her mind. She tried to hide around town stealing food from gardens and farms until a few nights ago when she completely lost her mind.
- After the night she became fully insane, she remembers nothing.

Tillie begs you to enact justice upon the monk and slay him for the terrible things he did to her.

> It is up to you how you would like to end this adventure. If it is just a one-shot adventure the players could go back and kill the monk or perhaps make sure that the town performs their own justice upon him. If this is part of a larger long-lasting gaming group, perhaps you could have the monk escape while the party was looking for the girl and become an ongoing villain for the party. Whatever you choose, make sure that the town is very grateful for the party's help and they are rewarded handsomely.
